## Background

So, the idea of having to design a application as an excercise has not become too comfortable to me yet. I have always been pretty eager to create my own apps and projects, but the lack of free time kind of suppresses me. The situation is the same even now, as I work 4 days a week and try to complete some studies at the same time.

So here are the two factors to consider:
- How to decide on a subject that is simple enough so that I have enough time and resources to complete it along with everything else?
- How to sill choose a subject that is both generally beneficial to learn and a bit innovative at the same time?

Since application development is somewhat creative process and thus has characteristics of art as well, I may choose a pretty simple and useful application to hone my skills as a developer, and just add my own twist there so it become unique.

## Application idea
I will create a discussion application mentioned in the courses example applications. I think different kinds of message/image boards are still pretty solid part of internet and I have always considered them useful.

### The twist:
I will add a mini-game to the software. Basic use of the program will randomly reward resources used to play. The idea behind this is to encourage users to be active on the application. The game will not be anything too fancy, maybe a text-based rpg, stats are determined by items (maybe cards) received by using the application.

This should not be too complicated or time consuming to create and yet the application will have a bit of depth. To be honest, I maybe overestimating my capabilities or misevaluating how much there is to do, but at least now I have a direction to proceed in.
